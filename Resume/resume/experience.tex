                        Worked on CI/CD pipelines(Jenkins-based, involves Python/Bash Shell/Terraform/Ansible scripts) for building/testing/deployment jobs automation. Saved 20-30\% times for developers and operation engineers on related routines.
                    }

                    {
                        Designed and constructed logging solution(Loki/Grafana/K8S-based) to replace legacy log storage/browsing approach. Saved support and operation engineers 50-70\% times on log collecting/analyzing task. Also reduced about 40\% bug-fix/issue addressing time. 
                    }

                    {
                        Designed and constructed Python based client library/CLI-tool for programmatically interacting with cloud product. Saved customers and internal engineer teams 30-80\% time on infrastructure management. 
                    }

                    {
                        Designed and constructed internal metric backend(Django based) and dashboard(Grafana based). Helped engineer teams to track and optimize product related artifacts and internal costs. Also constructed Slackbot(bolt based) for costs related notification. Reduced about 5-15\% costs on cloud related platform. 
                    }
                \item
                    {
                        Surveyed and designed next generation CI/CD pipeline platform to replace Jenkins. Constructed prototypes on Argo, Tekton, Screwdriver and Circle CI. Helped engineer teams to understand pros and cons, and choose Argo based solution in the end. 
                    }

                        For critical issues which caused AWS service down or break service functionality, with my work, 20\%-55\% time could be saved for users who looked for workaround/solutions. Besides, if the problem involved bugs in AWS service side, I could save 15\%-40\% time for AWS developer team on tracing code or figuring out conditions to reproduce issues to solve bugs.

                        Under some circumstances, problems were caused by network connectivity/OS performance issues, or open source projects' source code/configuration. With my wild range of different troubleshooting skills and knowledge, 20\%-60\% time could be saved for users encounter these kind of issues.
