                        Being responsible for helping customers solve questions about container and deployment related AWS services, including: Amazon Elastic Container Service(Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), AWS App Mesh(AWS hosted Envoy control plane), AWS Code-series services(AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodePipeline), AWS Infrastructure as code services(AWS CloudFormation, AWS CDK), AWS X-Ray(AWS hosted tracing service) and AWS Batch.

                        Providing wild range support skills to assist customers.
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Providing general guidance about a service's feature or use case. Sometime, providing prototype or writing sample code for customers is required.
                            \item Tracking issue and providing workaround/solutions when the problem which customer encounter was caused by AWS services or infrastructure. Sometimes, I also helped AWS internal team trace services' or tools' source code.
                            \item Under some circumstances, problems were caused by network connectivity issue, OS performance issue, or open source projects' source code/configuration. Having wild range of different troubleshooting skills and knowledge was required.
                            \item Great communication skill to cooperate with customers to figure out real problems and most suitable solutions for them.

                    {
                        I worked on containerizing services for easier deploying and testing. Besides, I also constructed Drone and GitLab based  CI/CD pipeline to improve developing and releasing efficiency. It saved developers 50\% on handling releasing applications.
                    }

                    {
                        I constructed EFK based monitoring solution for services. It reduced 60\% time for developers to address issues and decreased 80\% service down time.

                        Solutions and applications were hosted on GCP and Docker Swarm cluster managed by me.

                        I constructed VoIP server for intercom system of parking lots which was based on FreeSwitch 1.6. And I developed VoIP client on Raspberry Pi in Python and C-Language. The system replaced phone based reported solution and saved 60\% costs.
                    }

                    {
                        I designed and developed a self-service system for parking lots to allow customers parking vehicles and paying by license plates without human parking officers, and a self-service system for restaurants to allow customers ordering and paying without human receptionist. It reduced users and parking lot managers/clerks 60\% of time on paying and verifying. Physical devices were RS-232 based, and controlling logic and communication were HTTP based.

                    {
                        I constructed and managed infrastructures(GCP and OpenVPN) and CD-chain(GitLab and Ansible based) for account and CRM(Customer Relation Management) server for self-serve system for parking lots and restaurants.
